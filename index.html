   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10004;  Leave the vehicle and follow the emergency escape route.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Turn off the engine immediately. Call emergency services.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Call emergency services. Wait at the scene for their arrival.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Pull as far left as possible. Turn off the engine. Notify emergency services.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: If your vehicle goes on fire in a tunnel, you should stop the vehicle as soon as possible, evacuate any passengers to a safe place, go to an emergency station and use the emergency phone to alert the tunnel operator. If traffic comes to a halt in a tunnel, switch off your engine to prevent a build up of fumes in the tunnel. Stay patient and follow the instructions of the tunnel operators.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Be aware for possible changes in road surface.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: As you enter the tunnel, turn on your dipped headlights and if you are wearing sunglasses, take them off. Tailgating could be particularly dangerous in a tunnel. So, while you are in the tunnel, keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front - the minimum safe distance for a car or motorcycle is 50 metres and for all other vehicles it’s 100 metres. Pay attention to any information signs displayed.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; The left exterior mirror only.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: When you are turning left, you should be aware that cyclists and other vehicles may come up on your inside. For that reason it is particularly important to check your left exterior mirror and your internal mirror before turning. Always use the Mirror-Signal-Mirror (blind spots)-Manouevre routine when you are turning and be extra careful If you have to cross a bus lane to make the turn.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Pull to the left-shoulder.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: If you get a puncture while driving, find a suitable and safe place to stop and change the wheel.

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; It has no effect.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Your braking distance is reduced.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: When it is wet, your tyres do not grip the road surface as well as when it is dry, your stopping distance is increased and you are more likely to skid. For these reasons you should slow down during or after rain and keep a greater distance from the vehicle in front.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; When driving using a high gear.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: The handbrake should never be used to bring a vehicle to a halt. This practice is potentially dangerous, as the rear wheels could lock up and the vehicle could skid out of control. In addition, using the handbrake does not operate the rear brake lights to warn following traffic.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; The driver should continue driving until it is safe to pull over.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: Driving when you are tired can be very dangerous, and tiredness is one of the main causes of serious road collisions. Being very tired may cause you to micro-sleep (or nod off momentarily). At l00km/h you travel at 28 metres a second, so if you micro-sleep for just 4 seconds you would travel over 100 metres without being in control of the vehicle. Never drive if you are fighting sleep. If you do become drowsy while driving, stop in a safe place and take a short nap. Then get some fresh air and stretch your legs for a few minutes before setting off again. Taking a caffeine-based drink such as coffee may also help.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; Using harsh acceleration. Careful braking. Excessive speed.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: Using harsh acceleration at the wrong time can cause a vehicle to skid, especially if the road is wet. Heavy braking can cause a vehicle to skid, particularly if the road surface is wet or uneven, or if the tyres are worn or incorrectly inflated. Read the road well ahead and try to avoid heavy braking, particularly in wet or slippery conditions. Excessive speed can also result in a vehicle going into a skid. You should always drive at a safe speed and never exceed the speed limit for the road you are on. Excessive speed is particularly dangerous in wet and slippery conditions.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10004;  That the load is evenly spread.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; That a license plate is clearly displayed.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; That the tyres are inflated adequately.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; That the side mirrors are properly adjusted.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: Proper weight distribution helps to ensure the stability of both the towing vehicle and the trailer. In the trailer, the bulk of the load should be over the axles. If a heavy load is positioned at the front of the trailer, this will result in too much ‘nose weight' on the hitch of the towing vehicle and make it difficult to steer. If a heavy load is positioned at the rear of the trailer, this will result in reduced weight on the rear axle of the towing vehicle, which will make it more unstable.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: Coasting is a bad practice that happens when a driver allows a vehicle to move by its own momentum (or by gravity - for example, down a hill) with the engine disengaged. This can be done in two ways: 1. By putting the car into neutral gear while moving; or 2. By keeping the clutch pedal pressed down to disengage the selected gear. If a vehicle is coasting, the driver has much less control, so you should never coast. However, it has no effect on the tyres.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item'>&#10060; The road holding ability of the vehicle doubles.</li>
   <li class='list-group-item'>Explanation: Driving at high speed is a factor that affects road holding. At higher speeds the airflow under a vehicle reduces tyre grip on the road and when you are approaching a bend or corner, the momentum of the vehicle makes it more difficult to change direction.</li>
